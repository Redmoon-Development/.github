## Redmoon Development

Redmoon Development is a set of personal development tools that are available with the goal of assisting with common usage tasks.

The Main Goal of these tools is be easily installed. Easy to use. It is part of Games as a Set of Tools.

In general, it is a collection of packages that have been developed to do specific things and help out with coding. Each Package is meant to be small and modular.
Well-Explained and meeting to code standards.

Requirements to be considered valid:
- Must meet standards to be uploaded to openupm.
- Must only use packages as git dependencies that meet standards to be uploaded to openupm.
- Must be Small and Modular for functionality. If there're multiple purposes to the module, then there should be an additional Module.
- Must provide Documentation on what dependencies are used and what they do.
- Must use the standardized Redmoon README Format with all appropriate sections filled out.
- Must include a modified MIT License that is Beerware.
- Must not be a sole implementation

Mostly for personal use, but I like to develop out and share.
